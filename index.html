    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m an Italian professional with a Master’s in Electrical Engineering and a strong background in analytical thinking, stakeholder engagement, and executive-level escalation management within multinational environments. After dedicating time to family, I focused on upskilling through cybersecurity and IT governance training, gaining knowledge in areas like NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and GDPR. I’m now looking to grow in a GRC, IT audit, or cybersecurity support role where I can apply my transferable skills and build hands-on experience in protecting organizations from emerging risks.</p>
