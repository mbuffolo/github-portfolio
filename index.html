    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I hold an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and have extensive experience managing high-level executive escalations and driving process improvements in multinational organizations.
In the last years I dedicated my time for family caring and upskilling into IT and cybersecurity, attending trainings and obtaining certifications such as the AKYLADE Certified Cyber Resilience Practitioner, Mastermind ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Lead Auditor, PRINCE2 Foundation, IT Network Security Specialist (ITS-102), and CompTIA Security+.
I also completed the micro-credential "Cybersecurity Standards and Risks" course at Munster Technological University, gaining expertise in NIST CSF, ISO 27001, GDPR, and other cybersecurity regulations.
With my newly acquired cybersecurity expertise and strong analytical skills from my engineering background, I am eager to apply my knowledge to security risk assessment and compliance. I am looking to grow in a cybersecurity, GRC or IT auditor role, where I can develop hands-on experience and contribute to protecting organizations from emerging threats
