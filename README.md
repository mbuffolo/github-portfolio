### 📝 Review of PwC Report about Conti cyber attack on the HSE using NIST CSF 2.0
- Scope: 
This review provides an analysis of the 2021 PwC report detailing the Conti ransomware attack on the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE). It identifies one significant weakness or risk for each of the six functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover and Govern.

For each identified weakness, appropriate security and privacy controls were mapped using NIST SP 800-53 and measurable metrics were proposed to assess the effectiveness of each control over time.
